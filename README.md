- 👋 Hi, I’m @bethhill29
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics and web development, with the intention of moving away from a science-based career to a more software-focused one
- 🌱 I’m currently learning flask for python with the intention of setting up my own website, while there's not a lot on here at the moment more will be coming soon!
